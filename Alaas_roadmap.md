---

### 1. Requirements & Planning
- Define business goals, target industries, and integration scenarios.
- Identify core AI capabilities (e.g., NLP, computer vision, predictive analytics).
- Determine compliance, security, and scalability needs.

### 2. Architecture Design
- Choose Azure services: Azure Machine Learning, Azure Functions, Azure API Management, Azure Key Vault, Azure Storage, Azure App Service/Container Apps.
- Design multi-tenant architecture for secure customer isolation.
- Plan for API endpoints, authentication (Azure AD), and usage metering.

### 3. Model Development & Training
- Prepare data pipelines using Azure Data Factory.
- Train and validate models in Azure Machine Learning.
- Register models and set up versioning.

### 4. Service Implementation
- Deploy models as RESTful endpoints using Azure ML or Azure Functions.
- Wrap endpoints with Azure API Management for unified access and throttling.
- Implement authentication and authorization (OAuth2, Azure AD).

### 5. Integration & Extensibility
- Provide SDKs or OpenAPI specs for easy integration.
- Support custom model deployment for advanced customers.
- Enable event-driven workflows with Azure Event Grid or Logic Apps.

### 6. Monitoring, Scaling, and Operations

- Implement logging, alerting, and automated retraining pipelines.

### 7. Security & Compliance
- Use Azure Key Vault for secrets and credentials.
- Ensure data encryption at rest and in transit.
- Implement role-based access control and audit logging.

### 8. Deployment & CI/CD
- Use Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for automated deployment.
- Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/Terraform) for repeatable environments.
- Blue/green deployments for minimal downtime.

### 9. Documentation & Support
- Create developer documentation and integration guides.
- Provide sample code and postman collections.
- Set up support channels and feedback loops.

### 10. Go-Live & Continuous Improvement
- Launch pilot with select customers.
- Gather feedback, monitor usage, and iterate on features.
