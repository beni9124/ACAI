Python roadmap for developing a Siemens NX add-on that leverages LLM/ML/AI to assist engineers in design, simulation, and ECAD tasks:

Roadmap: Siemens NX Add-on with LLM/ML/AI

1. Requirements & Research
Understand Siemens NX API and licensing requirements.
Identify key pain points for engineers in design, simulation, and ECAD.
Research available LLM/ML/AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, TensorFlow, PyTorch).

2. Environment Setup
Obtain Siemens NX license and set up NX environment.
Set up Python development environment (venv, requirements.txt).
Install necessary packages: pythonnet, nxopen, flask, tensorflow, transformers, etc.

3. Core Add-on Architecture
Use pythonnet or nxopen to interface Python with Siemens NX.
Design modular architecture:
Design Assistant: Suggests design improvements, automates repetitive tasks.
Simulation Helper: Analyzes simulation results, recommends optimizations.
ECAD Assistant: Assists with PCB layout, error checking, and documentation.

4. LLM/ML/AI Integration
Integrate LLM for natural language queries and documentation generation.
Use ML models for predictive analytics (e.g., simulation outcome prediction, design error detection).
Implement AI-powered search and recommendation systems.

5. User Interface
Develop a simple UI (web-based with Flask or NX-native dialogs) for user interaction.
Add search bar and chat interface for LLM queries.
Display results, suggestions, and visualizations.

6. Data Management
Store user queries, results, and design data securely (local files, database, or cloud).
Use Docker for containerization and persistent storage.

7. Testing & Validation
Write unit and integration tests for all modules.
Validate add-on with real engineering workflows.

8. Packaging & Deployment
Package the add-on for easy installation (pip, Docker, NX plugin format).
Provide documentation and usage examples.

9. Feedback & Iteration
Collect user feedback.
Continuously improve ML/AI models and add-on features.
